# XML

The `xml` data format parses data in XML format.
This plugin using [etree package](https://github.com/beevik/etree)

### Configuration

```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  files = [ "data.xml" ]
  data_format = "xml"
  
  ##  xml_query parameter using XPath-like query for limits the list of 
  ##  analyzed nodes. Default - "//"
  xml_query = "//Node/"

  ##  xml_merge_nodes determines whether all extracted keys will be 
  ##  merged into one metric. Default - false
  xml_merge_nodes = true
  
  ##  Determines whether the nodes should be parsed as array elements
  ##  When true, each node is analyzed separately and forms its own metric
  ##  This parameter changes the parser behavior. Default - false
  xml_array = true
  
  ##  If xml_node_to_tag equals "true", the name of the node is recorded 
  ##  in the tags with the key "xml_node_name". Default - false
  xml_node_to_tag = true

  ##  Indicates whether the parser will dynamically determine the data type 
  ##  in an element. Default - true
  xml_type_detection = true
  
  ##  Selected nodes or attributes will be added to each metric
  ##  Queries can be absolute or relative - in this case, 
  ##  query is executed relative to the current analyzed node
  xml_tags = [
    "//Node/Data"
  ]
  
  xml_fields = [
    "../Extra/@value"
  ]
  
  ##  Tag keys is an array of keys that should be added as tags.
  ##  Matching keys are no longer saved as fields.
  tag_keys = [
    "my_tag_1",
    "my_tag_2"
  ]
```

#### xml_merge_nodes

This parameter determines whether all extracted keys will be merged into one metric.  
For example, if your XML looks like this:
```xml
<VHost>
  <ConnectionsCurrent>0</ConnectionsCurrent>
  <ConnectionsTotal>0</ConnectionsTotal>
</VHost>
```
and **xml_merge_nodes = true**, you will get this metric:
```
file ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
```
therwise, each node will be written in a separate row:
```
file ConnectionsCurrent=0i
file ConnectionsTotal=0i
```

Setting a parameter to false can be useful, if your data is combined in one node and declared in its attributes:
```xml
<VHost>
  <Host_1 Name="Host" ConnectionsCurrent="0" ConnectionsTotal="0" />
  <Host_2 Name="Server" ConnectionsCurrent="0" ConnectionsTotal="0" />
</VHost>
```
Output with **xml_merge_nodes = false**:
```
file Name="Host",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
file Name="Server",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
```

#### xml_node_to_tag
This parameter determines whether the node name will be added to the tags.  
For a previous input example, if **xml_node_to_tag = true**:
```
file,xml_node_name=Host_1 Name="Host",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
file,xml_node_name=Host_2 Name="Server",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
```

#### xml_array
This parameter changes the parsing logic.  
When **xml_array = true**, parser will parse content and generate metric of each node separately.  
It\`s important that the XPath query must return an array of top-level nodes.  
  
The first situation is when your document looks like this:
```xml
<Document>
  <Server hosts_count="37">Server_primary</Server>
  <Data>
    <Host>
      <Name>Host_1</Name>
      <Uptime>1000</Uptime>
      <Connections>
        <Total>15</Total>
        <Current>2</Current>
      </Connections>
    </Host>
    <Host>
      <Name>Host_2</Name>
      <Uptime>1240</Uptime>
      <Connections>
        <Total>33</Total>
        <Current>4</Current>
      </Connections>
    </Host>
  </Data>
</Document>
```
With configuration:
```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  files = [ "data.xml" ]
  data_format = "xml"
  xml_query = "//Data/Host"
  xml_array = true
  tag_keys = [ "Name" ]
```
The result will be like this:
```
file,Name=Host_1 Uptime=1000i,Total=15i,Current=2i 1598637420000000000
file,Name=Host_2 Uptime=1240i,Total=33i,Current=4i 1598637420000000000
```
  
Another possible situation where the node names are different, but it is still an array:
```xml
<Document>
  <Server hosts_count="37">Server_primary</Server>
  <Data>
    <Host_1>
      <Name>Host_1</Name>
      <Uptime>1000</Uptime>
      <Connections>
        <Total>15</Total>
        <Current>2</Current>
      </Connections>
    </Host_1>
    <Host_2>
      <Name>Host_2</Name>
      <Uptime>1240</Uptime>
      <Connections>
        <Total>33</Total>
        <Current>4</Current>
      </Connections>
    </Host_2>
  </Data>
</Document>
```
For a similar result, a configuration like this will work for you:
```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  files = [ "data.xml" ]
  data_format = "xml"
  xml_query = "//Data/*"
  xml_node_to_tag = true
  xml_array = true
  tag_keys = [ "Name" ]
```
Result:
```
file,Name=Host_1,xml_node_name=Host_1 Uptime=1000i,Total=15i,Current=2i 1598638060000000000
file,Name=Host_2,xml_node_name=Host_2 Uptime=1240i,Total=33i,Current=4i 1598638060000000000
```

#### xml_tags, xml_fields
These parameters allow you to add data to the metrics from an arbitrary place in the document  
For the previous example, if we want to get the tag from the `Server` node 
and the field from the `hosts_count` attribute:
```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  files = [ "data.xml" ]
  data_format = "xml"
  xml_query = "//Data/*"
  xml_tags = [ "//Server" ]
  xml_fields = [ "../../Server/@hosts_count" ]
  xml_node_to_tag = true
  xml_array = true
  tag_keys = [ "Name" ]
```
Result:
```
file,Name=Host_1,Server=Server_primary,xml_node_name=Host_1 Current=2i,Total=15i,Uptime=1000i,hosts_count=37i 1598638060000000000
file,Name=Host_2,Server=Server_primary,xml_node_name=Host_2 Current=4i,Total=33i,Uptime=1240i,hosts_count=37i 1598638060000000000
```
  
Note:
 - even if the query returns multiple nodes, the value is fetched only from the first
 - Ð°dditional tags and fields are extracted from the document and added to the metric after analyzing the current node  
 This means that if the tag or field name matches the one already extracted, the key will be overwritten
 - the syntax for getting the attribute value given in the example (`../../Server/@hosts_count`) is unique and works only in this parameters
This is due to the fact that the package used was originally intended for easy navigation through document nodes.  
If you miss the capabilities provided by the parser, please open an issue with a description of the case - we will consider the possibility of switching to another library for working with XML.
  
You can find more information about XPath queries in the [documentation for the etree package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/beevik/etree?tab=doc#Path).  

#### xml_type_detection
By default, each value sequentially passes conversion attempts to Int64, Float64 and Boolean using **strconv**. If the conversion was successful, the result of the conversion is written in the field, otherwise the string is returned.
  
Since XML itself does not provide the ability to unambiguously determine the data type, you may want to control this yourself.  
When this parameter is `false`, all fields are written as strings. After that, you can convert each field to the type you want using [converter processor](../../../plugins/processors/converter).


### Metrics
If the node or attribute value contains only *\s*, *\t*, *\r* or *\n* characters, it will be discarded.
  
If your XML document is complex, you can try using [execd processor plugin](../../../plugins/processors/execd). Get your document through the [value parser](../value), and then use custom processor to retrieve data.
